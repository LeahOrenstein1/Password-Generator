# Professional Password Generator

This project is a **Professional Password Generator** built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to generate secure and customizable passwords through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). The user can specify the password length and customize the number of special characters, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters in the password. Additionally, the program offers a feature to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard for convenience.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Length:** Specify password lengths between 8 and 18 characters.
- **Character Customization:** Choose the number of special characters, digits, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters in the password.
- **Random Password Generation:** Automatically fills in any unused character slots with random characters if the specified total does not meet the desired password length.
- **Clipboard Copy:** Easily copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Real-time Validation:** The program checks whether the customization requirements fit within the specified password length and displays error messages accordingly.
- **Restart Option:** The application can be reset to its initial state with the restart button.
